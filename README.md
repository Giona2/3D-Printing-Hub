# 3D-Printing-Hub
## Description
Using the capabilities of Ultimaker Cura and a Raspberry Pi (the 4B model in my case), an upgrade to a Creality Ender 3 can be born. After installing Raspberry Pi OS Lite, cloning this repository, and running the setup.sh bash script, you should just be able to plug this newly made device into your nearest 3D Printer compatable with Ultimaker software.
